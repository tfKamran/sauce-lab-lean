## Setup

This repository contains a collection of automated web tests utilizing Selenium with the Chrome Web Driver. These tests open a webpage in Google Chrome and execute a series of test cases to verify application functionality.

The test suite is built using the popular JavaScript testing framework, [Mocha]([https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/)).

The `package.json` file includes script commands that leverage the Node Package Manager (npm) to run Mocha tests through the command-line interface (CLI). These commands are triggered by the `npm test` and `npm start` commands, respectively.
